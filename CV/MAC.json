My goal is to contribute with my initiative and dedication to achieve organizational goals and generate a positive impact.\nI apply several solid practices in my development approach. I employ the creation of reusable codes and libraries for future use, I like to always have a close correlation with my work team, that is, developers, designers and system administrators to identify new features. I like to cooperate with frontend developers for the integration of new user-oriented elements. I apply design, coding and documentation standards that allow the best understanding of the Work Team.\nI design and implement database schemas, in addition to having experience with different database management systems.\n\nI have 3 years of experience editing and correcting photos using tools such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom. In my work I always try to ensure that there is a correlation between lighting and shadows depending on the place where the photo was taken and the client's requests. I make the most of the different tools that give me great versatility when editing or retouching a photo, whether natural or studio."
